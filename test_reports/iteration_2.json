  "summary": "GrantFlow platform comprehensive testing of 3 new features completed: RBAC, Email verification/password reset, and OCR pipeline. Backend APIs 100% functional (30/30 tests passed). Frontend pages load correctly with proper UI elements. OCR is MOCKED with realistic extracted fields and confidence scores. RBAC enforces owner/imputernicit/consultant permissions correctly. Email verification uses token-based approach (no real email sending).",
